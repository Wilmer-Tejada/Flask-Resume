    description:
      - Created 10+ Power BI dashboards to track key metrics crucial to evaluating performance including enrollment counts, student success rates, retention rates, awards, etc.
      - Wrote 100+ SQL Server queries, sometimes involving millions of records.
      - Established a Git repository for standardized reports and queries.
      - Served as the liaison between analysts and the database administrators, managing a schema in SQL Server.
      - Fit a logistic regression model, using Python, to determine how a student’s GPA and highest level of high school English affect their chances of succeeding in college level English. This replaced English placement exams and we saw an increase in the number of students succeeding in college English by more than 5%.
